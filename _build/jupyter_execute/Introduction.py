This [book](https://causal-methods.github.io/Book) is a practical guide to Causal Inference using Python. I break down the methods and techniques that appear in the most prestigious Journals in Economics like American Economic Review and Econometrica. 

I don't assume any technical background, but I recommend that you be familiar with the concepts of my previous book: [Probability and Statistics with Python](https://prob-stat-python.github.io/textbook/Introduction.html).










**Material for Econometrics courses**

Syllabi, Slides/Notes, Python and R code  from my Bachelor, Master, and PhD courses in Econometrics can be found in my other [Github](https://github.com/VitorKamada).
